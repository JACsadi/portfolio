      <p class="about_description">
        Hi, this is JAC—probably the most chill, coolest, and funniest person
        you'll ever meet in your life (also, maybe the poorest). I'm the chill
        guy from that popular meme. I know I look like I might die any moment,
        but I have insane energy and I can chill all day.

      <p class="about_description">
        Born and raised in Sylhet, Bangladesh, I studied at Sylhet Government
        Pilot High School and Murarichand College. Right now, I'm pursuing
        Computer Science and Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and
        Technology (SUST).
      </p>
      <p class="about_description">
        I occasionally solve problems on Codeforces and often start projects I
        never quite finish. I love watching Test cricket and football. Back in
        school and college, I used to read a lot, and I’m really into indie
        movies. Travelling is something I enjoy, but most of the time, I'm broke.
        I’m also really passionate about wildlife, philosophy, politics,
        mythology, history, and things like that. And honestly, I don’t think I
        could live without music.
